=================

This is a [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) tap for installing
[Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org) related utilities. To use this tap
with Homebrew or linuxbrew - simply execute `brew tap
galaxyproject/tap`.

This tap is not for distributing actual Galaxy tool wrappers such as
the bioinformatics wrappers that appear in the Galaxy's user
interface. Those can be found in the Galaxy [Tool
Shed](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/).
